# vim_settings

## installation
Execute `install.sh`. Then.vimrc file and .vim folder will be added to $HOME/.

NOTE: Make sure your $HOME/.vim folder and $HOME/.vimrc file will be replaced. To avoid this, you have to install manually.

## requirement
You should clone Shogo/dein.vim to dein folder. For details, see other tutorials (I don't explain here).

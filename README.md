# vim_settings

## installation
Execute install.sh and .vimrc file will be added to $HOME/.

NOTE: Make sure your ~/.vim folder and .vimrc file will be replaced. To avoid this, you have to install manually.

You should clone Shogo/dein.vim to dein folder. For details, see other tutorials (I don't explain here).
